# Async Broadcast Server and Client

A simple asynchronous TCP broadcast system built with Python's `asyncio`. The server supports multiple clients, handles messaging and basic commands, and includes timeout handling. The client supports input, server messages, and a heartbeat mechanism. This project is based on a roadmap task to build a **CLI tool** that starts a **broadcast server**.

## üöÄ Features
### Server
- Asynchronous handling of multiple client connections
- Basic verification handshake using a `CONNECT` message
- Broadcasts messages from any client to all others
- Built-in command support:
  - `\\exit`: disconnects the client
  - `\\clients`: lists all connected clients
  - `\\ping`: silent heartbeat
- Automatic client timeout disconnection
- Graceful shutdown of connections
- Logging via a custom logger module

### Client
- Verifies connection with the server
- Async input from stdin
- Receives messages from server
- Sends periodic heartbeats to maintain the connection
- Cancels tasks on exit or error
   

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
### üì¶ Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- No external dependencies (pure standard library)

### Running the Server

```bash
python main_server.py
```
This starts the server on the specified host and port.

#### üîß CLI Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| --host | Broadcast server host (default: '127.0.0.1') |
| --port | Broadcast server port (default: 8888) |

### Running the Client
```bash
python main_client.py 
```  
On startup, the client connects to the server, sends a verification message (CONNECT <username>), and starts listening for input and incoming messages.

#### üîß CLI Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| --host | Broadcast server host (default: '127.0.0.1') |
| --port | Broadcast server port (default: 8888) |
| --user | Username (default: anonymous) |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- Linux-only: The client relies on `sys.stdin.readline()` with run_in_executor, which behaves correctly only on Unix-like systems (Linux). Windows users may experience blocking or undefined behavior.

- Blocking Input: The client uses `run_in_executor()` for terminal input. This operation is not cancellable and will wait indefinitely until input is received.

## Example

Start the server:
```bash
python main_server.py --port 6969
```

In another terminal, run the client:
```bash
python client.py --port 6969 --user Attila
```
Commands:
- Send a message to all users by typing and pressing Enter.
- Use `\\exit` to leave the client.
- Use `\\clients` to see active clients.
